# Kitchen_Manager

### Target Audience
Chefs, restauranteurs, and kitchen managers

### Problem
Often times chefs rely on multiple programs to track the operations of their kitchen. This can take away productivity as they move from one program to another to update inventory, manage menues, and track recipe and food costs.

###
Kitchen_Manager tries to simplify a chef's workflow by offering inventory management, menu development and pricing, and recipe costing and development in one place. Chefs will be able to see immediately what their purchase price, actual price, and suggested menue price are based on their orders and portion size. In future developments, chefs will also be able to add staff profiles and write schedules all under one roof.
